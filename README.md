# Implementing Hierarchical Related Ecological Regression with STAN

## Main file

  - ecoreg.stan.R: Should be able to run directly 
    - simple ecological regression takes about 35 minutes for 2000 iterations, converges well
    - complex model takes >23 hours for 500 iterations (not yet reached convergence)
